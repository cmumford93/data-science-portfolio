263120,"<strong>OVERVIEW </strong><br>2098. Mankind has left the Earth and is now living in space colonies. Ludwig, a research robot from a faraway civilisation and his spaceship are looking for forms of new energy. Unfortunately, mankind´s new space colonies are not listed on his interstellar maps, which results in a fatefull crash with the physis, the biggest station with a billion inhabitants. The crash does not only tear a huge hole into the physis´ protective cover, but also damages Ludwig´s spaceship badly enough for him to lose control of it and crashland on planet Earth. Now it´s a race against time. <br><br>Will Ludwig succeed and get his spaceship going in time to save the physis? <br><br><strong>FEATURES </strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Explore the area where the spaceship crashed or an enormous dam, travel by balloon through the snow and ice or cross an almost endless desert. There’s so much to discover! <br></li><li>Find the weirdest components and construction plans. Use them to develop practical new gadgets to supply Ludwig with energy! <br></li><li>Discover physical phenomenons and analyse them in order to reveal the laws of physics and solve the tricky puzzles in the game. <br></li><li>thrilling storyline arching over 4 unique environments <br></li><li>more than 8 hours of gameplay <br></li><li>developed with physics-teachers, pupils and educators - 100% curiculum based <br></li><li>comes along with didactic materials for school useage</li></ul><br><strong>WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT</strong> <br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>The game tells the story of &quot;Ludwig&quot; - a small research robot who is on an important mission to find new forms of energy for the home planet of the Robotronics. After a long journey he finally reaches earth - just to find it abendoned. Humans exhausted nearly all energy sources and left the planet. They live in big space stations. Unfortunately Ludwig hits one of these spacestations with his spaceship and crashes down on earth. A damaged spaceship, a far away homeplanet in desperate need of energy know-how and 1 billion humans in a damaged spacestation - now it´s up to you as a player to clean up this mess! <br></li><li>While following the storyline Ludwig has to learn about the human technologies on earth. Starting with the most basic form of energy production - combustion - he has to advance through a techtree to find and learn about more sophisticated forms of renewable energy. <br></li><li>Ludwig doesn´t know anything about the laws of physics on earth (remember - he´s an alien from a far away robot civilization called the Robotronics...). So he uses his scanner to find and analyse physical phenomenons which appear in the gameworld. All the knowledge is stored in a dynamical conceptmap - the knowledgebase. <br></li><li>The knowledgebase is empty when you start the game. While playing, it fills step by step with new nodes. You will end up with a huge concept map of physical knowledge on renewable energies. (developed together with physics teachers and educators). <br></li><li>The game features 4 unique &quot;themeworlds&quot;. These quests in these environments are based on a specific topic (combustion, water power, wind energy, solar energy). The themeworlds are connected by the storyline. <br></li><li>Every themeworld features a minigame - called laboratory. A laboratory illustrates the core knowledge of the themeworld (for example: How does a pumped storage power station work? or Where should i place my windmills to get the most efficient energy output? <br></li><li>All this educational gameplay is nicely embedded in the storyline. The game is NOT devided into playing- and learning- or assesment elements. You always KEEP PLAYING the game! <br></li><li>Ludwig is designed to be fun to play (please judge for yourself ;-) but it can also be played in schools. The game comes along with a set of didactical materials for teachers to support embedding Ludwig in classes.</li></ul>",,,,,,,ovos,,0.0,,,,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263120/header.jpg?t=1447359401,,,,,Ludwig,,,,,,,,,,9.99,9.99,ovos,,,,"Jun 6, 2014",0,,"Join Ludwig on an exciting journey through the world of physics.

Azrael's duty was to ferry the souls of mankind to the creator for judgement once their time here had come to an end. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">In the beginning, Azrael shared The Creator's affection for humanity.  But over time, Azrael's affection turned sour as the wickedness of humanity grew more and more.  Azrael fiercely proclaimed that mankind had grown arrogant, ignorant and blasphemous.  Humans spat at the name of their very maker.  Azrael's resentment consumed him after The Creator stubbornly showed infinite patience and favor to the profane humans.  And so, Azrael denounced his title and his role. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Azrael sought out a manner to enact revenge on The Creator - through us.  Azrael sewed war among the eight kingdoms and unleashed the sickness known as &quot;Devil's Plague.&quot;  For every soul that perished, Azrael forced into service into his army with hopes to eradicate humanity and eventually, if possible, The Creator.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">​<br>But, one man stood against Azrael.  Corbin Delacroix fought through The Right Hand's demon horde and faced the fallen angel himself - and won.  But there must be an angel to usher souls into the afterlife, and so Corbin to the place of Azrael as the Angel of Death.  However, though Corbin was imbued with Azrael's power,  he was not immortal. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">After many years, Azrael's followers returned to finish what he could not.

<br />
You start off with the main chapter centered on the bizarre alien land as described in the book Gods and Nemesis: Leviathan Seed. Additional chapters will be added allowing you to advance your character. <br />
<br />
As the chapters are added for you to explore, Gods and Nemesis: of Ghosts from Dragons will unravel into a multiplayer open sandbox RPG. One thing you will notice upfront is every asset is crafted from scratch. Future chapters will include a survival-based world that will invite you and your friends to adventure the main storyline, find side quests, unravel secrets, or create and play your own epic quests within a truly alien environment. Once you get used to the asymmetrical world with its fresh layout within the first chapters, future chapters will be released that includes giving an open-world experience. Are you an explorer or dungeon crawler? Are you a survivalist or crafter? Maybe you want to begin creating your own quests as a modder-- the future chapters will give you incredible options.<br />
<br />
Features of this first chapter <br />
• 1st chapter will be approximately one hour of average play <br />
• Engaging storyline <br />
• Intro to the alien world with in-game tutorials <br />
• Several Side quests and Easter Eggs<br />
<br />
   The 1st chapter will be scheduled on the release date for free. Additional chapters will be added over time based on overall support. Several chapters are already mapped out and will be available soon along with expanded content including the open-world experiences.  Although these systems work, the project will require additional developers to create a steady stream of content. In order to stand by my promise of releasing this game, I will release the 1st chapter which will have a great deal of content in itself. I believe that this will inspire the needed support for the planned Gods and Nemesis universe. Keep in mind that there is a unique burden of describing a truly alien world because there is little to relate with -- it must be played for someone to understand its potential and appeal and this is why the first chapters are deeply story-driven.",,,,,,,Chad Meffert,,,,,,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/509530/header.jpg?t=1642465936,,,,,Gods and Nemesis: of Ghosts from Dragons,,,,,,,,,,,,Chad Meffert,,,,"Apr 1, 2017",0,,Explore the bizarre alien land as described in the book Gods and Nemesis: Leviathan Seed.

Expect to read lots of notes and dialogue. This game is intended for those who enjoy a fun, spooky, tale that provides a more 'on rails' experience.<br><br>Linear Gameplay: CURSE is a linear experience with some light branching that gives players some determination of events. The game is linear at a high level to tell a cohesive story.<br><br>Ghost Chase: The ghost chase feature is tense. It's supposed to be tense. The ghosts will arrive at random points within the Manor to attack you. Did we mention that the lights go out when they attack?<br><br>Point and Click Navigation: CURSE does NOT allow free movement. We intend to create an experience more like a theme park ride where we control aspects of what you see and don't see. If you give in to this type of storytelling, you should have a rollicking good time. If you prefer actively moving through the game space, CURSE may not be for you.<br><br>Jump Scares: Although the game does not rely on jump scares to entertain the player, it does include more than a few. <br><br>Horror Elements: The horror of CURSE is geared towards a PG-13 vibe than R or MA ratings. We strive for atmosphere over gore and graphic violence.

You are Hoffman, a genius scientist who left behind in the polluted Earth, dedicates himself to escape to Mars. With your &quot;friend&quot; Swimmy, a one-manned spaceship, you will escape from Megaquake and harsh natural conditions such as flood, blizzard and strong magnetic flux. You will navigate into abandoned cities to avoid touching the surface and head for the higher ground. But don't worry. Your spaceship, Swimmy has numerous amazing modules to help you find a way to the extraction point. Test your driving skill from collapsing cities and devastating Earth environment. Good luck with your trip.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Key Features</strong></h2><br><br><strong>3D racing-like adventure.</strong><br>You will drive a spaceship, &quot;Swimmy&quot; to navigate the skyline of the city. It has incredible speed and propulsion that allows you fly and jump above buildings. You have to travel further and faster to avoid death.<br><br><strong>Don't touch the ground.</strong><br>Surface is very unstable due to strong geomagnetic flux. Navigate with rooftops of buildings to avoid getting close to the ground. Always look for HIGHER GROUND. Ocean is also not safe to land since your spaceship will sink. <br><br><strong>Megaquake will destroy cities.</strong><br>If you delay, Megaquake will devastate everything including you and the city. You have to escape from the city before destructive L-wave catches you. Buildings will likely fall and collapse on your way. Moreover, buildings will be destroyed randomly and unpredictable ways. Move faster, otherwise you will have no place to step on. Drive while you can. <br><br><strong>Advanced Modules.</strong><br>Your spaceship is equipped with very high-tech modules, which is intended for space travel.

Almost everything is out of context.  A random character, word, or sentence here or there. On the other hand, trying to learn Japanese by watching anime or reading manga is overwhelming (for a beginner).</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">We try to strike a balance between these two worlds.  This game strives for <strong>“Mild Immersion.”</strong>  We want to immerse you in Japanese as much as possible, but only beginner Japanese. We want you to feel confident that any Japanese that comes your way is something you’ve been taught and are capable of understanding at a basic level.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Small Step Immersion</strong></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">This game also strives for <strong>“Small Step Immersion.”</strong> We want to immerse you in Japanese one small step at a time. After learning a new hiragana, you will soon learn words spelled with that hiragana and immediately start seeing and hearing those words in dialogue and battle.  Slowly, but surely, your vocabulary and reading ability will grow as the game gently immerses you, more and more. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""> </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">We believe context, immersion, and fun are key to effective learning. This game isn't just an RPG with Japanese flashcard-type battles. It is much more.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">What will I learn?</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><p class=""bb_paragraph"">How to read, write, and pronounce hiragana <br>Hiragana is a set of characters used to write Japanese words.  </p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Over 240 common Japanese words used in anime</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph"">136+ kanji used in the Japanese words</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Grammar to understand basic Japanese sentences (50+ tutorials)</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Listening skills with over 4000 lines of dialogue by pro Japanese voice actors</p></li></ul><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Practice 136+ kanji!</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">行 怖 可 愛 君 美 味 熱 痛 強 助 待 本 当 分 違 元 気 母 生 徒 先 遅 小 忙 下 猫 酷 人 間 船 男 頑 張 危 動 物 残 念 早 良 名 前 女 何 山 羊 豚 馬 鼠 寒 見 大 丈 夫 島 秘 密 面 白 友 達 犬 楽 彼 化 煩 誰 私 奴 変 皆 夢 無 理 持 別 日 陰 性 心 霊 水 僕 俺 冗 談 手 紙 悪 息 子 今 好 魚 来 不 音 蜂 必 要 鶏 庭 綺 麗 嫌 蜜 久 姫 天 使 蛇 蛙 配 疲 野 郎 次 雄 貴 様 弱 所 明 部 屋 花 落 着 砂 漠 終 鍵 敵 町 姉 事</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""> </p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Adaptive Dialogue System and how it helps you learn</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">The Adaptive Dialogue System helps you learn by doing.

We put a discussion our community board about this:  )<br><br>Done by professional astronomers, this VR experience takes you inside one of their NASA supercomputer simulations to within a few light years of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole lurking at the center of our galaxy.  Besides the black hole, the simulation shows one of its important feeding sources: stellar winds that are blown into outer space from stars orbiting the black hole.  These stellar winds slam into each other, heating the wind material to temperatures that are so hot -- tens of millions of degrees -- that they glow in X-rays.  When viewed from Earth, these same X-rays are detected by telescopes in space, in particular NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.  The stars and their stellar winds are seen by ground-based telescopes in Chile, among other places, but the only way to get a close up view is to go there yourself in this app!<br><br>In Galactic Center VR, fly around the few-light-year region around Sagittarius A*, seeing the orbiting stars, their stellar winds, and the X-rays they emit.  Or scale down the simulation so everything fits within your VR play area, allowing you to walk around the center of our galaxy.  View the whole simulation in stellar winds only, X-rays only, or both, as well as check out the contribution from just one stellar wind at a time.  There is also a tutorial explaining more about the simulation, which provides non-astronomers some pertinent background information.<br><br>This app was created by astrophysicists at the Instituto de Astrofísica, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, in Santiago.",,,,,,,"Instituto de Astrofísica, PUC de Chile",,,,,,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1240350/header.jpg?t=1593627805,,,,,Galactic Center VR,,,,,,,,,,,,"Instituto de Astrofísica, PUC de Chile",,,,"Mar 24, 2020",0,,Explore the center of the Milky Way like never before!,https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240350/,,,"English, Spanish - Latin America",,,Galactic Center VR,"Instituto de Astrofísica, PUC de Chile","Instituto de Astrofísica, PUC de Chile",13,4,"20,000 .. 50,000",0,20000.0,50000.0,35000.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I like the Top Down shooting game very much, but the existing games need a lot of time to collect equipment and upgrade, so I can't play with my friends who took part in the game, so I made this game, which is characterized by being frank and ready to start a game with my friends at any time.<br />
Of course, this is also the shortcoming of this game. There are no long-term items and no archives. If you like collecting, then this game will disappoint you. However, if you want to have a frank shoot and a shoot with your friends, then this game will definitely suit you.<br />
hard core, some BOSS checkpoints are still difficult and require a little skill.<br />

Now, only one thing can stop it- comedy warriors that compete in improv challenges to appease the evil spirit. If any of them aren't funny or mess up, they will be punished! <br />
<br />
BATSU! is a digital party card game full of hilarious improv challenges and humiliating or painful punishments! The game is based on the hit live Japanese punishment game show in NYC and Chicago. Put your “funny” friends to the test in improv challenges while risking a BATSU! (&quot;punishment&quot;, in Japanese.)<br />
<br />
Each round a different player is the judge. The judge of the round draws an improv Challenge Card for the other players to compete in. These could be anything from telling a story, to acting as props in a play. There is a deck of audience suggestions to switch things up every time a challenge is drawn. Different challenges require different types of suggestions. For example, the judge may draw a Place Card so the scene could take place anywhere from a baseball field to Mars. The judge then decides which player did the worst and deserves to be punished, Japanese game show style! <br />
<br />
In the live show, the cast and volunteer audience members get eggs thrown at them by the giant Mr. Chicken, are shot with a paintball marker, have to eat body sushi after it's been dipped in a hairy belly button full of soy sauce, or worse! Things are a bit tamer in the digital card game since our attorneys said it had to be, but it can still get pretty heated! For example, it could be something humiliating like calling a friend to tell an embarrassing story about you, or painful like getting an arm hair plucked out!<br />
<br />
Don't worry, we added a Mr. Chicken clause and before the game begins, players can agree on a punishment they’d have to do instead if they don’t want to do the BATSU! they have pulled. <br />
<br />
 In the end, players are either funny or get punished!",,,,,,,Giant Fox Studios,,,,,,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1399940/header.jpg?t=1666935496,,,,,BATSU!,,,,,,,,,,,,Giant Fox Studios,,,,Coming soon,0,,Compete in hilarious improv challenges!

feature where you may double-click on any tile to mark it.<br>Marked tiles will be highlighted in a magenta colour, making it easier to keep track of them<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/saved_word.PNG?t=1617285653"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Getting a Closer Look</h2>You may find it helpful to get a closer look at the board. <br>At any time you can use the mouse wheel to zoom into the board.<br>While zoomed in, you may use the middle or right mouse buttons to pan across the board.<br>Zooming out will automatically re-center the board<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/pan_zoom.PNG?t=1617285653"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Tile Types</h2>In the game there are 7 types of tile, these include wood, bronze, silver, gold, diamond, bomb, and burning.<br>Non-wood tiles are known as special tiles.<br>Bronze, silver, gold, and diamond are the most common special tiles you will encounter.<br>You may have noticed they do not have a face value, this is because they work a bit differently.<br>Bronze, silver, gold, and diamond have a 0 value, however they will multiply the score of your word by 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.<br>This will be reflected in the points breakdown, where the multiplier values will themselves be multiplied together if multiple special tiles are used.<br>Bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and bombs will appear when words are made with scores greater than or equal to 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 points respectively.<br>When special tiles are earned, one will always appear, however this one and subsequent tiles will only have a 50% chance of spawning an additional special tile.<br>Special tiles can appear anywhere, even over existing special tiles, so use them up before you risk finding your hard-earned diamond turning into bronze!<br>Furthermore every tile that spawns to replenish the board has a 1% chance of being any of the special tile types<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/tile_types.png?t=1617285653"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Bombs</h2>Bombs are unique, they are the only type of tile that can not be selected.<br>A bomb will explode should any word be made that is directly adjacent to it.<br>When a bomb explodes, it will destroy nearby tiles, and you may notice burning tiles are left behind.<br>The points value of any exploded tiles will be added to your score.<br>Burning tiles are tiles that were caught on fire from the explosion, use them up quickly, because they have a chance to spread with every new word made!<br>Note that burning tiles have a multiplier of 0, and will nullify the score of any words made with them<br><br><i>A bomb</i><br><img class=""bb_img""

of the screen<br><br>First we have the exit button, this just brings you back to the menu<br><img class=""bb_img""

fun statistics about your word making including amount of words made, amount of tiles used, average score per word, etc. <br>You can also check words to see if they exist in the lexicon, which is especially useful for making long words<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/ui_options_info.png?t=1617285653"" /><br><br>The third button is for settings.<br>Here you can do many things including volume control, determining what genres of music will play, and adding or excluding your own custom words. <br>Note that although identical to the settings screen in the main menu, this screen also contains an option to show the FPS of your game<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1533570/extras/ui_options_settings.png?t=1617285653"" /><br><br>Lastly are the shuffle and rejuvenate buttons.<br>A shuffle can be done an unlimited amount of times, and will shuffle around the tiles on the board.<br>A rejuvenate will completely replace all of the tiles on the board, however these are in limited supply.<br>Every time you level up, you will earn an additional 2 rejuvenates<br><br><img class=""bb_img""

Thank you guys!</i><br><i>Explosion™ is an indie puzzle game where your objective is to turn sad little houses into beautiful holes of destruction :D . But it's not all work: while you blow things up in some creative ways, your supervisor/friend/maybe more than friend Amber uncovers the mysteries behind the Corporation, putting you on a variety of adventures together. Are you ready for this ~explosion~ of emotions?</i><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892210/extras/gameplay.gif?t=1658337893"" /><br>The Explosion™ game is special as it excels in two distinct gameplay areas: Puzzles and Dialogues. In the puzzles, the satisfying animations, the creative and fun levels, the carefully thought out mental challenges and the cartoon aesthetic make the experience of destroying the little houses something relaxing and satisfying. In the dialogues, the light and humorous tone, the comfortable intimacy of the conversations and the deep and surprising story hold the player's attention and provide remarkable and intense emotions. More on these below.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Puzzles</h2><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892210/extras/puzzle.gif?t=1658337893"" /><br>In Explosion™, your objective is simple: to destroy all the houses on the map. To complete your mission - and make it more exciting, you will receive very creative combinations of explosives, different and unexpected mockups (levels), and beautiful and well thought out puzzles. Every 12 levels, you are introduced to a different mechanic, where the game gradually familiarizes you with it and prepares you for more challenging scenarios at the end. As you advance through the 44 levels in total, you will come across other sub-mechanics, which alter or subvert the rules of the game, adding even more complexity and reasoning to the proposed challenges.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Dialogues</h2><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1892210/extras/dialogue-en.gif?t=1658337893"" /><br>In addition to the puzzles, another crucial element of Explosion™ is the story - which is told through dialogue, like a visual novel. Amber, your head supervisor (and maybe a little more than that) is the one who welcomes you at the company and introduces you to your work. However, as time passes and you become more intimate, the work in the Corporation™ only gets more mysterious. Why are these houses being destroyed? Who is behind all these demolition orders? These are questions you and Amber intend to answer when you board on this great adventure. Conversations are well distributed throughout the beginning of the game's levels, and at each level #12 there is a unique mockup for important milestones and advancements in the story (with cute and stylized art too :3).<br><br><i>Want to know even more?

By merging with a stolen Slave Unit Prototype, Shou will become a furious Devil in pursuit of killing a false God.<br><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/02_Features_Banner.png?t=1744649010"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/03_Killer-Combos.gif?t=1744649010"" /><br><strong>KILLER COMBOS:</strong> Use swift swordplay, explosive ordnance, and stylish combos against an army of meat and metal.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/05_Death-From-Above.gif?t=1744649010"" /><br><strong>DEATH FROM ABOVE:</strong> Air juggling, dashes, and frequent target switching allow for you to take down foes of any size while wall-jumping and platforming can help you outmaneuver your enemies.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/Graffiti_row_01.png?t=1744649010"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/07_Fight-For-Your-Life.gif?t=1744649010"" /><br><strong>FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE:</strong> Conquer mini-bosses, set pieces, and climactic 1-on-1 encounters that offer intense challenges against unforgettable villains.<br><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/09_Strength-is-Nothing.gif?t=1744649010"" /><br><strong>STRENGTH IS NOTHING WITHOUT CONTROL:</strong> Use the Training Room to hone precise and powerful moves to string together devastating attack sequences.<br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/Graffitti_Row_02.png?t=1744649010"" /><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/11_Battle-to-the-Beat.gif?t=1744649010"" /><br><strong>BATTLE TO THE BEAT:</strong> A 90s-inspired soundtrack features heavy Drum’n’Bass and funky industrial music that adds to the thrill of combat.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/13_Feast-Your-Eyes.gif?t=1744649010"" /><br><strong>FEAST YOUR EYES:</strong> A unique visual aesthetic combines nostalgic 2D sprites with an advanced lighting system and stylized 3D environments.<br><br><strong>THE END IS NEVER THE END:</strong> After completing the campaign, further challenges await in an expansive and frenetic ‘Crimson Citadel’ procedural challenge tower with an online high score leaderboard and an unhinged, ultra-hard battle with SovKhan in his ultimate form, a.k.a. “SovKhan 300%.”<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/15_Footer_Banner.png?t=1744649010"" />",35.0,https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/storepagebackground/app/1903910?t=1744649010,False,"2, 5",full,"<img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903910/extras/01_Intro_Banner.png?t=1744649010"" /><br><br>From the top of Megacity S1-9, the Sovereign Khan rules with fists of iron and flesh.

One night they encounter a pair of otherworldly creatures, Porcus and Purrsula, and are whisked away to a mysterious place known as Draconia - a legendary land full of monsters to befriend and treasures just waiting to be discovered.

One night they encounter a pair of otherworldly creatures, Porcus and Purrsula, and are whisked away to a mysterious place known as Draconia - a legendary land full of monsters to befriend and treasures just waiting to be discovered. The adventure Erik and Mia have always dreamed of is finally underway!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">＜Setting＞</h2>DRAGON QUEST TREASURES is all about the thrill of adventure—and that means treasure hunting!<br><br>The adventure takes place in Draconia, a land that's home to countless pieces of precious loot.<br>Join Erik and Mia as they search for the legendary Dragonstones, picking up as much treasure as they can along the way!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">＜Base＞</h2>With the threat of rival treasure-hunting crews looming large, Erik and Mia form a gang of their own and snag a base of operations. Every piece of loot they acquire adds to the total value of their treasure vault. When this value hits a certain point, their gang will go up a rank, unlocking new treasure-hunting abilities and the option to add to the base's amenities.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">＜Rival Gang＞</h2>Treasure hunting gangs have been known to flock from far and wide in the hope of striking it rich. “Rival Gangs” will stop at nothing to get their hands on Erik and Mia’s treasure – from attacking out in the field to launching a raid on base.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">&lt;Field＞</h2>Draconia was formed from the bodies of two enormous Golden Dragons. Over the rocky eons their rocky remains have eroded away to leave six floating islands. Erik and Mia can scout five very different biomes in their hunt for treasure, from volcanic mountains and bone-dry deserts to frozen wastelands. Each island in inhabited by various types of monsters. Using the powers of the “Dragon Daggers”, Erik and Mia can recruit monsters to join their gang. Each monster has a special ability called a 'Forte', allowing them to soar through the air or dive into the ground to bypass obstacles enroute to the loot. By working together with their well-manner monster, Erik and Mia hunt for treasures buried across the lands of Draconia!<br><br>*Please thoroughly review the product content and bonuses before purchasing, as this product has a “standard edition” and a “digital deluxe edition”.",,"Square Enix, TOSE CO., LTD.",50.0,0.0,,http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256960536/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1690559745,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2021210/ss_22360b120f2812873277b9427490bf7de8d325c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1718209507,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2021210/header.jpg?t=1718209507,"© 2022 ARMOR PROJECT/BIRD STUDIO/SQUARE ENIX All Rights Reserved.<br />

In Arriaka's depths, you once manipulated DNA for false identities, served time, and earned a 2nd chance at Plumbella Corp.  Your expertise birthed a potential cure for &quot;Morbus Malkov,&quot; a coveted breakthrough for megacorporation factions.  </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Now a target, they'll stop at nothing to seize your creation. But you refuse to surrender without a fight. Because if there's one thing everyone lives by is the mantra &quot;Success is the only thing that matters&quot;.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Arriaka can be a dark place, a dangerous and lingering moloch of a city. Yet, there's enough place to slip through the cracks and it can be funny and entertaining as well. Every character you meet there enriches the story and deepens the immersion as the different paths unfold before you. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">A big cast of characters from all walks of life awaits you.

Built for deep space operations, exploration, and ... household activities. She's always been by your side since she came with the house you bought before starting at Plumbella. A-Z is kind and sweet but can be ferocious and direct. Her production line was decomissioned by the state authorities after a droid uprising in the Mars asteroid belt but somehow managed to slip through the cracks.

The “humanism” spirit brought by the Renaissance was replaced by “technologism”. People believe that the development of technology will bring unlimited freedom and even create infinite possibilities. For example, the invention of electronic brains allows people to truly feel what is “imagination without boundaries”. The invention of electronic limbs and auxiliary body parts allows people to see and accept the death of God in religion and the birth of God in technology.<br><br>People have become accustomed to and enjoy letting technology dominate everything, from birth to death, from three meals a day to work and leisure, as long as they have money, they can live like gods. There has never been a kind of capitalism that makes everyone so firmly believe in the power of money. Money buys technology, and technology summons God.<br><br>Of course, the remnants of the old enlightenment’s “humanism” have not been extinct. They can always survive on the edge of cities and networks. In 2098, in New Dragon City of the American Federation, an organization called “Imune” removes identity chips for people for free, to get rid of the information control of the capital government union on individuals. At the same time, the advertising department of Pineapple Dragon, the largest company in New Dragon City, is hunting down “Imune”. The player-controlled “chef” is one of the leaders of “Imune”. According to the law designated by Pineapple Dragon and the government, such a thought criminal as “Imune” will be subjected to “thought deprivation” punishment, implanting brain invasion accessors for criminals, and providing some customers with special services-legal brain invasion (role-playing), to deprive thought criminals of their right to use their own brains.<br><br>Some thought criminals will act as cleaners on the outer walls of skyscrapers, some will be arranged as executioners for illegal violent organizations, and of course, there are also some low-stimulation occupations, such as some thought criminals will be assigned to snack stalls as stall owners. It should be noted that this service is different from the “Braindance” system used by ordinary customers. After all, BD is just a kind of “replay”, but this service provides a kind of “realest experience”. Customers can see in reality the consequences caused by their own actions.<br><br>In snack cart No. 98, players will invade into the brain of a former leader of the “Imune” organization, play as a chef, cook pancakes and get feedback from “customers”.",,,,,,,Off Lab,,0.0,,,,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2361840/header.jpg?t=1709520879,,,,,Cyber Puncake,,,,,,,,,,6.99,6.99,Off Lab,,,,"Feb 29, 2024",0,,"Welcome to your favorite TV show “Goodies Everyday”. &quot;BD Plus&quot; that lets you live different lives in others’ brains.

Additionally, unexpected events and emergencies can arise, such as getting sick or dealing with a sudden financial crisis, which can impact your progress and force you to adapt to new challenges.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508130/extras/3.png?t=1725274141"" /><br><br>The ultimate goal of the game is to survive and thrive in the big city.

The book is your weapon, and your only one. Your life depends on it.<br />
<br />
The book starts out as as a weak projectile, but with the power of adding pages with upgrades written on them, the book can change and morph into what is needed. Upgrades range drastically with some playing a more supportive role such as a laser sight or a more offensive role, like changing your projectiles into knives.<br />
<br />
New pages can also be written by finding ink during runs. These pages can be written before a run starts to have a chance of dropping during the next run.<br />

OK, maybe it wasn’t… </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">But if it had, <i>Eclipse Breaker</i> would have been the kind of game you rented from a video store and played obsessively. Now, returning to your save file after 25 years, this lost classic is making its grand return; fully “remastered” (read: developed from scratch) with smooth mechanics, enhanced visuals, and the challenge modern roguelike fans crave.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>The Story: A Hero Out of Time</strong></h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Back in ’99 you led paladin <strong>Ember</strong> toward a showdown with the rogue sun‑goddess Solara… then life (or a corrupted save) intervened. Twenty‑five years later, you’re loading that save again. Ember returns to a world still shrouded in darkness, hailed as myth by some and blamed by others. To restore the sun, she must storm the Divine Realm run after run, mastering new powers and rewriting fate until the cycle finally shatters.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong><i>Developer's Note</i></strong></h2><p class=""bb_paragraph""><i>Hey everyone, I’m Jorge Rodriguez, the developer behind Eclipse Breaker. This game is a love letter to the roguelikes and PlayStation-era RPGs that shaped my love for gaming: fast-paced battles, deep mechanics, and a world full of mystery and danger. We’ve had a blast crafting this ‘remaster’ of a game that never actually existed, and I hope you enjoy discovering it as much as we enjoyed making it.</i></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><i>If you’re curious, try the demo! Your feedback means the world to us, and we’d love to hear what you think. Whether you’re here for the strategic combat, the nostalgia, or just to break the cycle, thanks for giving Eclipse Breaker a shot. Now get out there, challenge the gods, and let’s see if you can survive.</i></p>",,,,,,,"Lunar Workshop, Jorge Rodriguez",,,,,,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2815060/header.jpg?t=1746575112,,,,,Eclipse Breaker,,,,,,,,,,,,Lunar Workshop,,,,2025,0,,"Eclipse Breaker is a strategic action roguelike: dodge, parry, and strike in real‑time combat where every second counts.

2870070,"My Grandpa's Haunted House is a 2D top-down survival horror game based on the story of a girl named Emily who has returned to her grandpa's house from abroad only to find out that her grandpa passed away and his spirit got trapped in the house by a Demon.<br><br>During the early 1990s, Emily grew up living in her grandpa's house. She had a lot of fun memories with her grandpa in that house. During the early 2000s, she moved out of her grandpa's house and went to a foreign country in pursuit of better career opportunities. One day, she got a letter from her grandpa's address that stated his deteriorating health conditions, which compelled her to return to her country. But little did she know that her grandpa had already passed on 2 years ago and his house was full of the Evil spirits. The letter was delivered to her just to lure her back to her grandpa's house so that the spirits could take away her soul too.<br><br>After entering the building she called out to her grandpa but was met with silence. She realized that something was wrong and she started looking for him in the kitchen, dining and bed rooms. When she first came across her grandpa, she calmed down for a while thinking that he was okay. But when he got taken away by a Doppelganger right before her eyes she realized that it was her grandpa's spirit. The spirit taking him away looked exactly like her, with the same hair style which she used to wear when she was a child. This incident made her so angry that she wanted to fight back but it was a tall order for her without the expert's help. She took away her grandpa's belongings in a silver box in order to free her grandpa's spirit. Only if it were that simple.

One player takes on the role of the monster, or 'Stalker', who hunts down the survivors with its powerful psychic abilities. The other three players are the survivors, or 'Crew', who must find a way to escape.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Indoor Chase</strong></h2>The Stalker chases the Crew through a narrow and complex facility, relying on sound and terrain features. The Crew must overcome and utilize the limitations of restricted vision in this complex indoor environment to achieve their goal.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Escape scenarios</strong></h2>Escaping the facility won't be simple. The Crew must complete one of the 'escape scenarios' to make their way out. Observe the current situation carefully and figure out the most appropriate way to escape. Cooperate with other Crew members to achieve the goal quickly. Escape the facility before being overwhelmed by the Stalker's abilities.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Stalker and Abilites</strong></h2>The Stalker has various abilities at its disposal. Decrease the Crew's sanity with powerful psychic abilities. A Crew member with low sanity is much easier to hunt down. Erode the facility and destroy doors to leave the Crew with nowhere to run.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Crew and Items</strong></h2>The Crew can find plenty of items throughout the facility. Use these itmes wisely to delay the Stalker's pursuit and stay alive.

3281490,"In a world ravaged by a relentless zombie apocalypse, survival means more than just fighting the undead. In Farming Through The End, players must balance the need for resources, fortification, and combat with the desperate necessity to grow food in a dying world. Civilization has collapsed, cities are overrun, and survivors are scattered. The only chance for long-term survival lies in returning to the roots of humanity—farming.<br />
<br />
You play as a lone survivor or a small group struggling to maintain a patch of land in the midst of chaos. Hordes of zombies roam the landscape, and survivors may become your allies or enemies. Scarce resources, unpredictable weather, and the constant threat of the undead will push you to your limits.<br />
<br />
Grow crops, tend to livestock, and build makeshift defenses to protect your farm. At night, beware: zombie hordes are drawn to signs of life, and your farm will face relentless attacks after dark. Fortify your land, craft traps, and ensure your defenses hold through the night.<br />
<br />
During the day, take your trusty pickup truck and explore the desolate world to scavenge for scrap, materials, and valuable supplies. Visit abandoned towns, forests, and junkyards in search of rare items that can be used to upgrade your farm, repair your vehicle, or craft powerful new weapons. But be careful—these excursions are risky, and you may encounter both zombies and rival survivors along the way.<br />
<br />
A thriving barter economy also emerges as you sell your raised crops to other survivor groups in exchange for better equipment, advanced weapons, and critical materials. Strengthen your farm, evolve your defenses, and gain access to powerful tools to survive. Will you prioritize upgrading your truck for safer scavenging or fortify your farm to withstand larger hordes?<br />
<br />
Survive, grow, and thrive—if you can—by Farming Through The End. Explore, defend against nightly zombie assaults, build alliances, and turn your farm into a fortress in a collapsing world.",,,,,,,Resilient Roots Games,,,,,,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3281490/header.jpg?t=1743671945,,,,,Farming Through The End,,,,,,,,,,,,Resilient Roots Games,,,,Coming soon,0,,"In Farming Through The End, players navigate a zombie apocalypse by growing food, gathering resources, and fortifying their land, as farming becomes humanity's last hope for survival.",https://store.steampowered.com/app/3281490/,,,English<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support,,,Farming Through The End,,,0,0,"0 .. 20,000",0,0.0,20000.0,10000.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3611710,"<p class=""bb_paragraph"">HideSeekBattle: A Style-Differentiated Scenery and Multi-Character Hide-and-Seek FPS Game  <br> <br>In the independent game field full of endless possibilities, HideSeekBattle is a unique multiplayer and AI online hide-and-seek FPS game. It ingeniously combines the fun of hide-and-seek with the tension and excitement of FPS games. Through diverse character settings and scenes with various styles, it brings players an unprecedented gaming feast.  <br> <br>Core gameplay of the game  <br> <br>The core gameplay of HideSeekBattle integrates the classic hide-and-seek mode with the FPS shooting mechanism. In each game, players will be assigned to different roles and take on different identities to engage in intense confrontations in complex scenarios.  <br> <br>Hunter  <br> <br>As a key figure in tracking and hunting, the hunter possesses a variety of powerful weapons and practical skills.  <br> <br>The weapon systems are rich and diverse: machine guns, pistols, knives, shotguns, sniper rifles, and rifles.  <br> <br>Unique and practical skills:  <br> <br>Throwing Molotov Cocktails: Hunters can throw Molotov Cocktails forward. The Molotov Cocktails will explode upon hitting the target or upon landing, and will produce a continuous flame effect. This skill is very effective in narrow passages, enemy assembly areas, or situations where it is necessary to restrict enemy movement. It can cause massive damage to enemies at critical moments and create opportunities for offense or escape for oneself.  <br> <br>Healing skill: Considering that the game is full of various dangers and challenges, hunters are bound to suffer damage during battles. The healing skill can help hunters quickly restore a certain amount of health when their life points are low, enabling them to maintain the fighting state and continue to counter the attacks of enemies.  <br> <br>Sprint Skill: The Sprint Skill endows the hunter with the ability to move quickly on the field. When the hunter detects the position of the enemy or needs to evade the enemy's attack, he can instantly release the Sprint Skill and move rapidly in the direction of the target. This skill not only enables the hunter to be more swift when pursuing the enemy but also helps him evade attacks in time when danger approaches.  <br> <br>Insider  <br> <br>The main weapon of the traitor is a knife. His aim is to approach the hunter skillfully and stab him to death.  <br> <br>Disguise and Hide: The traitor needs to make use of various coverings and obstacles in the scene to conceal his whereabouts and quietly approach the hunter. During the chase and counter-chase, the traitor must remain vigilant at all times, look for the hunter's flaws, and then launch a sudden attack to deal a fatal blow to the hunter without being detected.  <br> <br>Pig  <br> <br>The pig character possesses a unique ability to shrink.  <br> <br>Flexible and agile movement: When the pig activates the shrinking skill, its body will become small and flexible. It can take advantage of this feature to easily squeeze into various narrow spaces, such as pipes, drawers, and corners filled with clutter. This concealment method enables the pig to hide itself in places where enemies are hard to notice, avoiding the pursuit of hunters and creating opportunities for the team to survive.  <br> <br>Chicken  <br> <br>The skill of chickens is that they can throw basketballs and cause the effect of stunning enemies.  <br> <br>Tactical Distraction: During the game, the player controlling the chicken can disrupt the enemy's action rhythm by throwing basketballs at them. When the basketball hits the enemy, the enemy will be temporarily stunned, during which their actions will be restricted and they will be unable to fight normally. This provides an excellent opportunity for teammates to attack or escape, enabling the team to better formulate tactics and achieve their goals.  <br> <br>Item  <br> <br>The special ability of the item character is invisibility.  <br> <br>Sneak Attack: With the ability to become invisible, the item character can approach the enemy without being detected and launch a surprise attack. On the battlefield, the invisibility ability enables the item character to become a secret weapon for the team, quietly approaching those vigilant hunters or other important targets and delivering an unexpected blow to them.  <br> <br>Stylized scene design  <br> <br>HideSeekBattle features a variety of stylized scenes, each of which adds a unique atmosphere and challenge to the game.  <br> <br>Game Features and Enjoyment  <br> <br>Strategic Game: Support Multiplayer Mode.  <br> <br>A thrilling showdown with AI: Besides playing against other players, HideSeekBattle also supports online multiplayer with AI opponents. The AI opponents have highly intelligent behavior patterns, capable of responding and making decisions differently based on the players' actions. Engaging with AI not only enhances the challenge of the game but also provides players with opportunities to hone their gaming skills.  <br> <br>HideSeekBattle, with its unique character designs and stylized scenes, offers players an intense and enjoyable multiplayer and AI online hide-and-seek FPS gaming experience. Whether it's competing against opponents in tense and thrilling battles or exploring the unknown mysteries in mysterious scenes, players can find their own joys and sense of achievement in the game.</p>",,,,,,,GuXian,,0.0,,,,,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3611710/98811db5f1afdca4196a01eb20e0725f859c1921/header.jpg?t=1748766074,,,,,HideSeekBattle,,,,,,,,,,1.99,1.99,GuXian,,,,"Apr 25, 2025",0,,"The core gameplay of HideSeekBattle is to organically combine the classic hide-and-seek mode with the FPS/TPS shooting mechanism.
