### 6. Algorithmic Trading Strategy
Skills: Quantitative Finance, Backtesting, Algorithmic Trading
Tools: Python, Backtrader, Pandas
Description: Designed an algorithmic trading strategy that uses technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, MACD, RSI) to generate buy and sell signals. Backtested the strategy on historical stock data to evaluate its performance.
Highlights:

Developed a technical trading strategy based on popular financial indicators.
Backtested the strategy using Backtrader.
Calculated performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio and drawdowns.
