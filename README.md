# Data Science & Quantitative Finance Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I showcase my projects in data science, machine learning, and quantitative finance. 

## About Me
I hold a Master's degree in Applied Statistics and have experience in software engineering, machine learning, and finance. My focus is on leveraging statistical models and data-driven techniques to solve complex problems in finance and beyond.

## Projects
Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

### 1. Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
**Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**Description**: A machine learning model that predicts stock prices based on historical data. I explored various models such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, and LSTM for forecasting.
